# Enhanced Vehicle Lighting Controls
## Description
Get more control over your vehicle! This mod allows you to silence sirens with one key press, Toggle your headlights between full and low beams, Toggle the interior light and actually use your indicators!    

### *Controller Support*:
This mod supports controller input with the use of a modifier button, which by default is the Left Bumper. To change the button binding, See the ‘Mod Settings’ section of the .ini file.
Keep in mind that whilst holding the modifier button, only some basic driving functions are enabled.
