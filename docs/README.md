# Enhanced Vehicle Lighting Controls
## Description
Get more control over your vehicle! This mod allows you to silence sirens with one key press, Toggle your headlights between full and low beams, Toggle the interior light and actually use your indicators!    

### *Controller Support*:
As of v0.2.0 this mod has basic controller support. Despite this, i still recommend using a keyboard for the best experience as nearly all the controller buttons are pre mapped to native functions leading to conflicts. I am working on improving this for a later release.

## Known Bugs and Issues:
- Sometimes when the mod first loads the input is unresponsive; To fix, simply reload the script via the ScriptHookVDotNet console (F4 by default). I've only noticed this while using LSPDFR.
